# Help supporting the extensions

There are various ways you can help:

- Answer issues raised
- Propose fix for issues and/or feature requests (through Pull Request)
- Propose new features (through Pull Request)
- Get more involved by [becoming a project maintainer](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-contrib.github.io/issues/new?template=help-with-maintenance.md)
- If you have no time but money, [ask on the community forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/meta/8); people are always looking to contribute to Jupyter through paid jobs

You can involve yourself in only one project or multiple ones depending your appetite (or is it your time).
